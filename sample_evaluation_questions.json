    "Reliability refers to the consistency and stability of test scores across different conditions, times, or forms. It indicates the degree to which a test produces consistent results when measuring the same construct. High reliability means that if the same person takes the test multiple times under similar conditions, they would get similar scores.",
    "Criterion validity refers to how well a test predicts or correlates with an external criterion or outcome (like job performance or academic success). Construct validity refers to how well a test measures the theoretical construct or trait it claims to measure (like intelligence or personality). Criterion validity focuses on prediction, while construct validity focuses on theoretical accuracy.",
    "The main types of reliability coefficients include: 1) Test-retest reliability (stability over time), 2) Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha, split-half), 3) Inter-rater reliability (agreement between scorers), and 4) Parallel forms reliability (consistency between equivalent test versions). Each type addresses different sources of measurement error.",
    "A correlation coefficient of 0.85 in test validation indicates a strong positive relationship between the test and the criterion being validated against. This suggests good validity evidence, as 85% of the variance (r² = 0.72) in one measure is associated with the other. Values above 0.70 are generally considered strong evidence for validity.",
    "The standard error of measurement (SEM) estimates the precision of individual test scores. It's calculated as SEM = SD × √(1 - rₓₓ), where SD is the standard deviation of test scores and rₓₓ is the reliability coefficient. The SEM indicates the range within which a person's true score likely falls, helping interpret score precision."
